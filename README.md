Gui Launcher
===========

This tiny program can help you to create launcher in windows. 
It simply reads the .ini file and create the process, that's it.

### Usage
For example, if you want to create a shortcut for sublime_text as 'st':

1. build the code or grab the binary from release
2. change the file name to st.exe and st.ini
3. change the content of st.ini, point the exe value to your sublime_text's location
4. copy st.exe and st.ini to windows directory. Done
